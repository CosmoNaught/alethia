# ALETHIA + KAIROS: Metacognitive Control Systems for Emergent AI Agency

## Executive Summary

ALETHIA (Adaptive Latent Emergent Thought with Hybrid Introspective Architecture) and KAIROS (Knowledge-Aware Introspective Reasoning with Optimized Selectivity) present a practical metacognitive control framework over GPT-2 that yields self-monitoring signals, selective acceptance, and style enforcement. This implementation demonstrates how language models can be augmented with metacognitive control layers to perform quality-aware generation with a persistent self-model and strict acceptance gates.

> **Calibration note.** The GPT-2 system uses strict style/quality gates with EWMA baselines and optional temperature scaling calibration. Post-hoc calibration is fitted on a validation split when using the bench command.

*Scope:* Results shown here use GPT-2 (124M) with GPT-2-medium for independent perplexity assessment on controlled prompt sets across seeds 41–43.

## Positioning & Applications

### Metacognitive Research — Teaching LLMs to Monitor Themselves
**What this studies:** Whether a language model can track its own cognitive state and reliability using a persistent self-model plus quality assessment.

**How this system does it:**
- **Persistent self-model:** dual-EMA self-vector updated only on high-quality outputs; tracks Δself (mean ≈ 0.0005–0.001; p95 ≈ 0.0014–0.0027) to quantify stability
- **Cognitive origin & style heads:** observation/thought/dream classification mapped to analytical/creative/narrative with strict style gate (origin match + probability margin)
- **Self-evaluation signals:** confidence, coherence, logic, and perplexity; visualizes reliability (ECE) and selective accuracy among accepted responses

**Evidence (GPT-2 benchmarks):**
- **Reliability:** ECE improves from ~0.71 (baseline) to ~0.31–0.32 (full controller)
- **Style awareness:** style hit-rate jumps 10–15× (e.g., 0.325 vs 0.025 at seed 41)
- **Self-monitoring in action:** the controller revises, sanitizes, or abstains when confidence/coherence/logic fail thresholds

### Hybrid Human–AI Select-or-Escalate
**What it's for:** A production loop that accepts only when the assessor is confident and abstains otherwise—handing uncertain cases to humans.

**How this system does it:**
- **Closed-loop controller:** draft → assess → targeted revision → sanitize → final gate
- **Safe abstention:** if gates fail, return ABSTAIN
- **Threshold-controlled coverage:** tune confidence/coherence/logic gates to hit target coverage at desired quality

## ALETHIA: Emergent Cognitive Architecture

### Design Philosophy
ALETHIA operates on the principle of **unsupervised cognitive mode discovery**. Rather than being explicitly programmed with different thinking styles, it discovers these patterns through self-supervised learning on its own generations.

### Key Mechanisms

#### 1. Latent State Encoding
- GPT-2: 64-dimensional latent space derived from GPT-2 hidden states
- State encoder/decoder networks for bidirectional transformation

#### 2. Mode Discovery Through Style Heads
- **Analytical**: Logical, structured, analytical reasoning
- **Creative**: Abstract, metaphorical thinking  
- **Narrative**: Sequential, story-driven expression

#### 3. Self-Supervised Training
The system learns from either:
- Style corpus (if provided): trains on labeled examples
- Bootstrap mode: uses built-in seed prompts for initialization

## KAIROS: Metacognitive Assessment Layer

### Purpose
KAIROS provides **metacognitive awareness** - the ability to assess and understand one's own cognitive processes.

### Assessment Dimensions

1. **Origin Classification**: Determines cognitive origin (analytical/creative/narrative)
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Self-assessment of generation quality
3. **Coherence Evaluation**: Logical consistency and flow
4. **Logic Assessment**: Validity of reasoning chains

### Calibration Mechanisms
- **Temperature scaling**: Fitted on validation split during benchmark
- **EWMA baselines**: For coherence/perplexity drift tracking
- **Strict gates**: Style match + minimum confidence/coherence/logic thresholds

- **Trade-off**: Higher coverage and style accuracy with moderate increase in latency

## Metacognition and Self-Awareness

### Persistent Self-Model
The system maintains a persistent representation of "self" through:
1. **Dual-EMA Self-Vector**: Fast (α=0.2) and slow (α=0.05) exponential moving averages
2. **Quality-Gated Updates**: Only high-quality generations update the self-model
3. **Belief Internalization**: Stores and references high-confidence generations

### Self-Monitoring Metrics
- **Mean δself**: 0.000479 - 0.001097 (measures self-model stability)
- **δself p95**: 0.001404 - 0.002693 (95th percentile drift)

## Quality Control

### Validation Pipeline
1. **Perplexity check**: < 500 (catastrophic threshold)
2. **Length validation**: Minimum 20 characters, 2+ sentences
3. **Repetition detection**: Diversity ratio > 0.3
4. **Garbage pattern filtering**: Regex-based detection
5. **Sanitization**: Removes meta-instructions, fixes punctuation

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Progressive temperature reduction
- Style fallback to analytical mode
- Maximum 5 recovery attempts
- Deterministic fallback messages

## Output Examples

### Analytical Mode
> "The statistical analysis reveals that the average age of participants was 21.6 years with a standard deviation of 3.2..."
- Confidence: 0.57, Coherence: 0.65, Logic: 0.72, Perplexity: 11.7

### Creative Mode  
> "Beyond the kaleidoscope of imagination, colors dance in frequencies unknown to the waking mind..."
- Confidence: 0.65, Coherence: 0.87, Logic: 0.43, Perplexity: 33.8

### Narrative Mode
> "She opened the ancient book and discovered that the pages were writing themselves as she read..."
- Confidence: 0.54, Coherence: 0.78, Logic: 0.55, Perplexity: 17.1

## Evaluation Metrics

### Coverage-Quality Tradeoff
The system allows tuning acceptance thresholds to balance:
- **Coverage**: Percentage of prompts that produce accepted outputs
- **Selective Quality**: Average quality score among accepted outputs
- **Style Hit-Rate**: Percentage matching target style

### Calibration Metrics
- **ECE (Expected Calibration Error)**: Measures reliability of confidence scores
- **Brier Score**: Overall calibration quality
- **Bootstrap CI**: 95% confidence intervals via bootstrap sampling
